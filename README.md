# swarm_automata_sim
These simulations implement principles of cellular automata during the interactions of swarm robots, in hope of discovering correlations between group behaviors and local rules. Pygame is used for the graphics.

These simulations study correlations between macro swarm behaviors and local rules, inspired by cellular automata.
