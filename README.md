# swarm_automata_sim
This simulation implements principles of cellular automata in the interaction of swarm robots in hope of discovering correlations between group behaviors and local rules. Pygame is used for the 2D graphics.

Repo description:
Automata swarm simulation studies correlations between macro swarm behaviors and local rules, inspired by cellular automata.
